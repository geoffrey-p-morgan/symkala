Functional Organization Manual – Version 2.0

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION
MANUAL
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Functional Organization Manual (FOM) is the authoritative source that
documents the current organization structure, missions, functions and tasks of the Department and its organizations.
It is a core reference document for the Department to describe what gets done by whom, for whom, and under what
authorities. It is a “living document” that, over time, will reflect key changes that lead to refined organizational
processes and procedures, and further enhance synchronized and coordinated actions across the Department to
ensure optimal execution of the VA mission and strategy.
The FOM is available on the VA intranet in a searchable repository. The Office of Policy, within the Office of Policy
and Planning, is responsible for the maintenance and updating of the FOM.

INTRODUCTION
The Department of Veterans Affairs was established as an independent agency under the President by Executive
Order 5398 on July 21, 1930, and was elevated to Cabinet level on March 15, 1989 (PL No. 100-527).
The Department’s mission is to serve America’s Veterans and their families with dignity and compassion, and to be
their principal advocate in ensuring that they receive medical care, benefits, social support, and lasting memorials
promoting the health, welfare, and dignity of all Veterans in recognition of their service to this Nation.
VA is the second largest Federal department and has over 312,000 employees. Among the many professions
represented in the vast VA workforce are physicians, nurses, counselors, statisticians, architects, computer
specialists, and attorneys. As advocates for Veterans and their families, the VA community is committed to providing
the very best services with an attitude of caring and courtesy.
VA comprises a Central Office (VACO), which is located in Washington, DC, and field facilities throughout the Nation
administered by its three major line organizations: the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits
Administration (VBA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA).
Services and benefits are provided through a nationwide network of 151 medical centers, 820 community-based
outpatient clinics, 300 Vet Centers, 56 regional offices, and 131 national and 90 State or tribal cemeteries. (Statistics
current as of September 30, 2013.)
The Secretary of Veterans Affairs (SECVA) identified three strategic goals for VA to focus on as the means to improve
services to Veterans and their families and to improve management in the Department. These goals are the
components of the 2014-2020 VA Strategic Plan:
•

Strategic Goal 1: Empower Veterans to Improve Their Well-being

•

Strategic Goal 2: Enhance and Develop Trusted Partnerships

•

Strategic Goal 3: Manage and Improve VA Operations to Deliver Seamless and Integrated Support

ORGANIZATION OF THIS VOLUME

This volume describes the structure and functions of the four highest echelons of the U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs. The section following this one provides a high level overview of the Department, including the Secretary of
Veterans Affairs and all of the key officials. This section is followed by individual sections for each VA Administration
and Staff Office. Heading styles are used to help clarify the structure of the Department. Each heading style
/Department of Veterans Affairs Functional Organization Manual/Introduction

Page 1

Functional Organization Manual – Version 2.0

corresponds to a different level of the Department. Heading level 1 indicates the Secretary, the Deputy Secretary, or
the Chief of Staff(Echelon 0), an Under Secretary (Echelon 1) or an Assistant Secretary (Echelon 1), or their
immediate offices. Heading level 2 indicates a Deputy or Principal Deputy Under Secretary or Assistant Secretary
(Echelon 2) or their immediate offices. Heading level 3 indicates a Deputy Assistant Secretary or Executive Director
(Echelon 3). Heading level 4 indicates an organization that reports to a level 3 organization. Heading level 5 is
reserved for paragraphs providing an organizational mission, an overview of the organizations structure and
function. Mission statements, organizational overviews, functions and activities are introduced using heading level
5. Missions cascade from Echelon 1 to Echelon 4, and are positioned at the beginning of each Echelon 1 section.
Overview, Functions and Activities are provided for organizations at all levels. For this reason, heading level 5 can
directly follow any other level of heading.

ORGANIZATION OF THE DEPARTMENT

VA Leadership

The Secretary of Veterans Affairs (SECVA) is the head of VA and is appointed by the President, by and with, the
advice and consent of the Senate. The SECVA is responsible for the proper execution and administration of all laws
administered by the Department and for the control, direction, and management of the Department.
The Deputy Secretary of Veterans Affairs (DEPSECVA) serves as the Department’s Chief Operating Officer. The
DEPSECVA directs the policy and operations of the Department and provides broad direction to the Department’s
employees through the Administrations and Staff Offices, ensuring coordinated action and conformance with the
SECVA’s directives. The DEPSECVA chairs the Department’s governance process through the Strategic Management
Council (SMC) and leads the Business Oversight Board and Capital Investment Board.
The Chief of Staff of Veterans Affairs (COSVA) oversees the day-to-day operations of the VA staff, and ensures
effective and efficient functioning to support the SECVA, DEPSECVA, and other Departmental leadership. The COSVA
synchronizes and coordinates policy guidance and direction of the SECVA with the administration, Staff Offices, and
other key officials.
The Department has three Administrations that provide for the delivery of services and benefits, seven Assistant
Secretaries who advise and support the SECVA and the Administrations, and Staff Offices that provide specific

VETERAN HIRING INITIATIVES
As the Nation’s largest integrated health care system, VHA has seen an increase in the number of service men and
women who are dealing with pressing mental health challenges that may include, but are not limited to Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, or readjustment to civilian life. The Mental Health Hiring Initiative
(MHHI) was launched as a result of congressional hearings and an Executive Order requiring VHA to hire additional
mental health clinical and non-clinical staff to serve Veterans. In order to meet hiring goals, VHA began an aggressive
recruitment campaign that coordinated efforts at the national, regional (VISN) and facility level. This major effort,
known as the Mental Health Hiring Initiative, provided oversight of the national recruitment, marketing and hiring
strategies needed, as well as tracking measures developed to identify these positions nationwide.
These efforts were focused on bringing new mental health providers into VA as effectively and efficiently as possible
through coordination with human resource officers nationwide. The VA Human Resources community and the Office
/Veterans Health Administration/VHA Office of the Under Secretary For Health (10)

of Mental Health worked in partnership to move quickly and efficiently through the hiring process to hire the best
qualified professionals.
Through the success of the Mental Health Hiring Initiative, VHA was tasked with leading the Peer Specialist and Peer
Support Hiring Initiatives, with the goal of increasing access to mental health care services for our Nation’s Veterans
by hiring new mental health professionals Over 800 Peer Specialist and Peer Support Apprentice positions were to be
filled by eligible Veterans and transitioning military personnel who have been successfully and actively engaged in
their own recovery of a mental health or co-occurring condition for a minimum of one year.

T HE G ERIATRICS AND E XTENDED C ARE S ERVICE (10P4G)
Overview

The Geriatrics and Extended Care Service (GEC) advances quality care for Veterans of all ages who are chronically ill
or elderly by providing policy direction for the development, coordination, and integration of geriatrics, hospice and
palliative care, and long-term services and supports, and for the advancement of geriatrics, hospice and palliative
care and long- term services and supports through research, education, and evaluation of new clinical models. The
shared purpose of all Geriatric and Extended Care programs goal is to prevent or lessen the burden of disability on
Veterans of all ages including older, frail, chronically ill patients and their families/caregivers, to maximize each
patient’s functional independence; and to optimize quality of life, or as appropriate, the quality of death. Because
the course of chronic illness varies, the health care needs of chronically ill patients also change, requiring the services
of one, some, or all Geriatrics and Extended Care long-term services and supports over time.
•

Functions and ActivitiesGeriatric Evaluation, Inpatient and Outpatient Geriatric Evaluation &
Management, and GeriPACT (formerly Geriatric Primary Care) offer interdisciplinary inpatient or outpatient
services to elderly patients that help clarify whether additional geriatric program(s) within or beyond VA
may be helpful for optimizing function and minimizing decline.

•

Geriatric Evaluation, for which every enrolled Veteran is eligible as part of his or her guaranteed Veterans
Benefits, is a clinical service available in a range of settings that consists of a multidimensional set of
evaluations leading to development of an interdisciplinary plan of care consisting of treatment,
rehabilitation, health promotion and social service interventions, on behalf of a chronically debilitated
Veteran, with the explicit intention of identifying and minimizing functional impairments and clinical needs,
both apparent and emergent. Geriatric evaluation may be provided in Specialized Geriatric Evaluation and
Management programs (see below), Community Living Centers, acute care, outpatient clinics, and HomeBased Primary Care.

•

Geriatric Evaluation and Management (GEM) is a specialized program of Geriatric Evaluation in an inpatient
or outpatient setting. The Goals and Objectives of GEM Programs are to: (1) improve the processes and
outcome of clinical care; (2) ensure efficient use of hospital and community resources; and (3) provide
geriatric education for health professionals and trainees.

•

○

In outpatient GEM, the initial assessment and development of the plan of care is followed by execution
of the care plan in the originating Patient-Aligned Care Team (PACT) or following the transfer of the
Veteran from PACT to a GeriPACT.

○

Inpatient GEM follows the process of initial assessment, development and implementation of a care
plan through an interdisciplinary team approach. Post discharge patients are followed by a GeriPACT
after transfer of primary care responsibility from the PACT.

Geriatric Patient-Aligned Care Team (GeriPACT, formerly called Geriatric Primary Care) provides patientcentered, interdisciplinary, team-based primary care to particularly frail and/or complex Veterans (often but

not exclusively of advanced age). GeriPACT offers geriatric evaluation followed by interdisciplinary provision
of medical, nursing, psychosocial, and associated health services for disease treatment and prevention;
health promotion and education of both patients and caregivers; referral for specialty, rehabilitation, and
other levels of care; caregiver support; and care management. The interdisciplinary GeriPACT team
members are trained specifically for geriatric evaluation and the management of health care issues
associated with chronic diseases and aging. GeriPACT is currently offered in about half of VAMCs and where
provided, collocated PACTs and their patients benefit from GeriPACT’s assumption of care of some of the
PACTs’ most time-consuming and resource intensive Veterans.
•

Home-Based Primary Care, Respite Care, Adult Day Health Care, and Long-Term Services and Supports Care
assist Veterans to remain in their homes through combinations of disease mitigation, functional support,
and caregiver support, either provided by or purchased from the community and coordinated by VHA staff.
○

Home-Based Primary Care (HBPC) is a home care program for which every enrolled Veteran is eligible
as part of his or her guaranteed Veterans Benefits. HBPC provides comprehensive, interdisciplinary,
longitudinal primary care in the homes of Veterans with complex medical, social, and behavioral
conditions for which routine clinic-based care is not effective or not feasible due to transportation
challenges. HBPC is designed to serve the chronically ill through the months and years before death,
providing primary care, palliative care, rehabilitation, disease management, and coordination of care
services. HBPC primarily targets three types of patients in need of home care: (a) longitudinal care
patients with chronic complex medical, social, and behavioral conditions; b) longitudinal care patients
who require palliative care for an advanced disease that is life limiting or refractory to disease
modifying treatment; and (c) patients whose home care needs are expected to be of short duration or
for a single problem not requiring an interdisciplinary team, when such services best help the facility
meet the needs of this population.

○

Respite Care is a general term for time-limited supervision and provision of supportive care for the
purpose of permitting a caregiver to attend to his or her own personal needs and well-being. Every
enrolled Veteran is eligible to receive up to 30 days of respite care per year as part of his or her
guaranteed Veterans Benefits. Respite may be provided through admission to an inpatient unit (acute
care, VA Community Living Center or community nursing home), as part of a Homemaker/Home Health
Aide service, or through a VA- or Community-Adult Day Health Care program.

○

Adult Day Health Care (ADHC) is a therapeutically oriented, outpatient day program for which every
enrolled Veteran is eligible, as part of his or her guaranteed Veterans Benefits. ADHC provides health
maintenance and rehabilitative services to frail elderly and functionally impaired Veterans in a
congregate setting. Individualized programs of care are delivered by an interdisciplinary team of health
professionals and support staff with an emphasis on helping participants and their caregivers to
develop the knowledge and skills necessary to manage care in the home. The program serves as day
respite for caregivers, often permitting ongoing employment in the face of a Veterans’ need for
constant supervision.

o

Purchased LongTerm Services and Supports (LTSS), for which every enrolled Veteran is eligible as part
of his or her guaranteed Veterans Benefits, permits dependent Veterans to remain living in the
community despite a need for daily support, such as assistance with medications, bathing, meals,
dressing, and mobility. LTSS are paid for by VHA but provided by community agencies or through other
fee-for-service arrangements, and include:


Homemaker/Home Health Aide (HM/HHA) to provide a need-based level of support in addressing
daily cares required for ongoing life in the community.

Purchased Skilled Home Nursing (PSHN) for time-limited skilled care (e.g., dressing changes,
medication infusion) that supports early discharge from hospital.

medication ordering and dispensing, and patient safety.

•

Academic Detailing Program in VISN 21/22 for Mental Health Initiatives was established as a joint initiative
between PBM and Mental Health Service, to guide evidence-based prescribing in mental health. Multiple
initiatives are improving care to patients with mental health conditions. Evidence-based clozapine
prescribing for treatment resistant schizophrenia increased with a statistically significant difference in rate
of change. Off‐label/non-evidence-based prescribing of antipsychotics was significantly reduced in patients
with diagnosis of dementia alone, and for patients with low doses of antipsychotics, and patients on
multiple antipsychotic prescriptions. Academic detailing on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) provided
1,184 unique clinicians with educational outreach visits using five Academic Detailing Clinical Pharmacy
Specialists in VISN 21 and 22. This initiative resulted in improved evidence-based pharmacotherapy (14- to
18-percent increase) for use of Prazosin with PTSD sleep disturbances.

VHA PATIENT-CENTERED CARE AND CULTURAL TRANSFORMATION (10NE)
Overview

The Office of Patient-Centered Care and Cultural Transformation (PCCCT) leads the transformation of health care
from primarily reactive, sporadic and physician-centered care to personalized, patient-centered care that is based on
relationships built on trust and committed to positive results over the Veteran’s lifetime. The PCCCT office has
defined patient-centered care as an approach to health care that prioritizes Veterans and their values, and partners
with them to create a personalized, proactive strategy to optimize their health and well-being, and minimize and
manage disease.
Patient-centered care “practice” begins with the Veterans’ vision of health and their goals. It links Veterans’
personalized health plans to what matters to them in their lives, and it supports them in acquiring the skills and
resources they need to succeed in making sustainable changes in their health and life. The “experience” establishes
continuous healing relationships and provides optimal healing environments. The ultimate results are better health
outcomes, improved quality of care, greater patient and provider satisfaction, and greater cost effectiveness.

Functions and Activities

PCCCT partners with VISNs, medical centers, and program offices to develop strategies and plans that implement
patient-centered care nationally.
•

Hears, informs, and represents the Veterans.

independent enterprise risk appraisal function by determining if OI&T risk management, controls, and governance
processes, as designed and represented by OI&T management, are adequate and functioning as anticipated. The
OI&T ERM Office of Risk Management Planning (RMP) identifies and addresses risks that affect the OI&T enterprise
as a whole. Once enterprise-level risks are identified and the impact to OI&T business processes determined, they
are presented to the CIO. This enables the CIO and Executive Leadership to make informed decisions on operations
designed to provide services to Veterans and their families, and provides OI&T the services it needs to achieve its
mission. OI&T ERM Risk Assessment and Mitigation (RAM) teams are available to assist the CIO and Executive
Leadership by performing root cause analysis assessments, recommending risk response and mitigation strategies,
and performing post mitigation assessments.
ERM also provides Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V) consisting of Systems Integration Testing and a

Service members being medically separated or retired and is administered jointly by DoD and VA. IDES has been fully
operational since October 2011 at 139 sites worldwide with over 30,000 service members currently enrolled.
Through the IDES process VA, DoD, and the military services have integrated their disability evaluation business
processes for those Service members being medically retired or separated so they operate concurrently rather than
consecutively. The IDES process is: a service member-centric process; less adversarial and more transparent than
the previous legacy process; more consistent in disability outcomes; simpler and quicker; and eliminates the
“benefits gap” for the delivery of disability benefits between VA and DoD.

Functions and Activities

for IDES.

•

Identifies and resolves obstacles and barriers, evaluates progress, and provides recommendations
